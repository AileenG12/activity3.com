        <p> People told me that I am super blessed with the talents that the Lord gave to me. I know the Lord gave this talents for me not only based on my own capabilities but it is all from and for the Lord. So that I give back to the Lord all the talents I have for Him. I am in the Music Ministry as Guitarist and most specially composing songs for the Lord. Other people also told me that I have skills in computer so my mom told me to take course related to computer but I didn't expect that this course is the reason why im crying every night when there's some error that I can't fix, joke.</p>
